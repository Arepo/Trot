Trot
--

This was the first unguided program I put together at Makers, with [NicolaiDTH](https://github.com/NicolaiDTH/)

It's Globetrotting app, that picks a semi-random vacation spot for you. That means it usually drops you in the sea (realism!), but if you're lucky it suggests a random country for you to visit. For some reason, Danny Dyer offers you the option to quit when you've had enough.
